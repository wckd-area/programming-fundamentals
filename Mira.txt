My name is Miroslava Ilkova. You can call me Mira. 
softuni: milkova
github: myilkova

I like to break things, travel, read SF books, watch GSL/IEM, woodworking and most of all I like to drink water, not the cold one.
I also like to create things and make them functional and beautiful.
I hope softuni will help me add more instruments to do this.
